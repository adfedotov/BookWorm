# BookWorm
BookWorm is a project developed to help people keep their initial thoughts on the books they have read. 

It is my personal project to get into python web development. This project was created to solve my personal problem of reading books
and quickly forgetting the main ideas and highlights from them. 

Technologies used: Python (Flask), HTML, CSS, jQuery, Quilljs for note taking

I would really like to get some feedback and criticism from professionals. It will help me to learn more and make my future
projects a lot better.

<h2>What I have learned</h2>
<ul>
  <li>It is pretty annoying to switch from one language to another if you want a real responsive web application JavaScript -> Python, but you get used to it quickly</li>
  <li>Never dive into backend with an idea, but without at least making a basic outline of web application visual functions</li>
  <li>Flask is very intuitive and you can possibly do so much if you use other python modules together with Flask</li>
  <li>Some books don't have ISBN?</li>
</ul>

<h2>To Do</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Solve a problem with repeated books from OpenLibrary API search module</li>
  <li>Replace OpenLibrary's API search empty covers like in note view</li>
  <li>PyTest</li>
  <li>edit Jinja Templates to eliminate redundancy</li>
  <li>Setup SMTP service to handle register messages</li>
  <li>Redesign with SASS, no bootstrap</li>
  <li>Docker</li>
</ul>

<h2>In the future</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Recommend books based on the user's books in the library</li>
  <li>An algorithm that recommends refreshing the memory of a book</li>
  <li>Make users able to make their notes public</li>
  <li>Deployment to AWS/Azure</li>
</ul>
